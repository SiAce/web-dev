Note about Bootstrap versions
Hi Everyone!

In this section Colt will teach you Bootstrap 3.

Bootstrap now has a new version (4). Colt teaches version 3 in this section and version 4 in the next.

While working in this section, please use the original documentation for version 3 and ensure that you're using version 3.3.7 in your code as you're following along with the lectures.

Why teach both versions?
Many companies still use version 3, so if you know both versions then you can easily help them migrate to version 4.

Also, the YelpCamp project in the back-end section of this course uses version 3, so if you don't know the version 3 syntax it will be more difficult to follow along.

Once you've completed the YelpCamp project, then you can use this guide to upgrade your code from Bootstrap 3 to version 4.



Thanks,
Ian
